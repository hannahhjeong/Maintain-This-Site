            Excerpt from Mierle Laderman Ukeles' Manifesto for Maintenance Art

      <br><br>
     <h2>A.  Part One: Personal</h2>
     <p> 
      <br><br>
          I am an artist. I am a woman. I am a wife. I am a mother. (Random order). 
            <br><br>
            I do a hell of a lot of washing, cleaning, cooking, renewing, supporting, preserving, etc. Also, (up to now separately) I "do" Art.
      <br><br>
          Now, I will simply do these maintenance everyday things,
          and flush them up to consciousness, exhibit them, as Art. I will live in the museum and I customarily do at home with my husband and my baby, for the duration of the exhibition. (Right? or if you don’t want me around at night I would come in every day) and do all these things as public Art activities: I will sweep and wax the floors, dust everything, wash the walls (i.e. "floor paintings, dust works, soap- sculpture, wall-paintings") cook, invite people to eat, make agglomerations and dispositions of all functional refuse.
      <br><br>
          The exhibition area might look "empty" of art, but it will be maintained in full public view.
      <br><br>
          <h1>MY WORKING WILL BE THE WORK</h1>
          <br><br>
<!-- <h2>B.  Part Two: General</h2>
<p>
Everyone does a hell of a lot of noodling maintenance work. The
general part of the exhibition would consist of interviews of two kinds.
<br><br>
<em>1.  Previous individual interviews, typed and exhibited.</em>
<br><br>
    Interviewees come from, say, 50 different classes and kinds
    of occupations that run a gamut from maintenance "man,"
    maid, sanitation "man," mail "man," union "man," construction
    worker, librarian, grocerystore "man," nurse, doctor, teacher,
    <br><br>
    museum director, baseball player, sales"man," child, criminal,
    bank president, mayor, moviestar, artist, etc., about:"
    <br><br>
    — what you think maintenance is;<br>
      — how you feel about spending whatever parts of your life you spend on maintenance activities;<br>
      — what is the relationship between maintenance and
      freedom;<br>
      — what is the relationship between maintenance and
      life’s dreams.
      <br><br>
<em>2.  Interview Room—for spectators at the Exhibition:</em>
<br><br>
    A room of desks and chairs where professional (?) interviewers
    will interview the spectators at the exhibition along same questions
    as typed interviews. The responses should be personal.

    These interviews are taped and replayed throughout the exhibition
    area.
    <br><br>
    </p>
<h2>C.  Part Three: Earth Maintenance</h2>
<p>
<br><br>
    Everyday, containers of the following kinds of refuse will be delivered
    to the Museum:
    <br><br>
      — the contents of one sanitation truck;<br>
      a container of polluted air;<br>
      — a container of polluted Hudson River;<br>
      — a container of ravaged land.
      <br><br>
    Once at the exhibition, each container will be serviced:
    <br><br>
    purified, de-polluted, rehabilitated, recycled, and conserved
    <br><br>
    by various technical (and / or pseudo-technical) procedures either by myself or scientists.
    <br><br>
    These servicing procedures are repeated throughout the duration of the exhibition. -->
